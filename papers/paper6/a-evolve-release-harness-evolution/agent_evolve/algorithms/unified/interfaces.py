"""Atomic action-space protocols: Reader, Operator, Verifier.

Every unified atom implements exactly one of these protocols. The uniform
signatures let :class:`UnifiedEngine` drive any recipe without knowing what
each atom does internally.

Signature rationale:
- ``context`` appears on ``Reader`` too (not only operators), so a downstream
  reader can see what upstream readers produced in the same cycle. Readers
  MUST treat ``context`` as read-only.
- ``state`` is present on every atom from day 1, even trivial stateless
  atoms, so Phase 2 can introduce stateful variants without signature churn.
- ``Operator.apply`` receives ``scope`` so it can refuse writes outside its
  allowed artifact set (raises ``ScopeViolationError``).
